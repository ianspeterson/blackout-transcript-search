0:00:00.000,0:00:01.625
In this video, I'm going to show you how

0:00:01.625,0:00:02.333
to make custom

0:00:02.333,0:00:04.000
multi-cell fixture profiles.

0:00:04.333,0:00:06.000
Hey everyone, today I'm launching a new

0:00:06.000,0:00:07.250
series all about making

0:00:07.250,0:00:09.083
custom profiles in Blackout.

0:00:09.291,0:00:10.750
If you've been using Blackout for any

0:00:10.750,0:00:11.708
amount of time, you know

0:00:11.708,0:00:13.083
that part of what makes Blackout

0:00:13.125,0:00:15.041
special as a lighting console is our

0:00:15.041,0:00:16.291
fixture database. We

0:00:16.291,0:00:17.833
have one of the best fixture

0:00:17.833,0:00:19.750
databases in the industry, and that's

0:00:19.750,0:00:21.125
because our profiles are

0:00:21.125,0:00:22.625
human-made and human-verified.

0:00:22.958,0:00:24.791
As you can see in our fixture database,

0:00:24.791,0:00:26.125
we have these green tags

0:00:26.125,0:00:27.666
next to all the profiles that

0:00:27.666,0:00:30.541
have been human-verified to work. And we

0:00:30.541,0:00:31.833
go a step further and use

0:00:31.833,0:00:33.291
these blue "prefer" tags

0:00:33.500,0:00:35.375
to tell you that these are profiles that

0:00:35.375,0:00:37.125
we recommend using for your sets.

0:00:37.625,0:00:39.750
Now this video is about making a custom

0:00:39.750,0:00:41.333
profile for yourself, but

0:00:41.333,0:00:42.250
I'm bringing up our fixture

0:00:42.333,0:00:44.375
database because one of the best things

0:00:44.375,0:00:45.583
you can do to set yourself

0:00:45.583,0:00:47.041
up for success if you have a

0:00:47.041,0:00:49.166
light that we don't have a profile for is

0:00:49.166,0:00:51.541
let us know. Use the help center and

0:00:51.541,0:00:52.458
request a new fixture

0:00:52.666,0:00:54.541
and we will have it in there very

0:00:54.541,0:00:55.875
quickly. But without further

0:00:55.875,0:00:57.583
ado, let's get into making our

0:00:57.583,0:01:00.333
own custom multi-cell fixture profile. As

0:01:00.333,0:01:01.333
a quick refresher, a

0:01:01.333,0:01:03.166
multi-cell profile is a profile that

0:01:03.166,0:01:05.708
contains multiple cells which are

0:01:05.708,0:01:07.708
essentially separate units within the

0:01:07.708,0:01:08.666
same profile that you

0:01:08.666,0:01:11.125
can control individually. Commonly, this

0:01:11.125,0:01:12.458
is used for pixels in a

0:01:12.458,0:01:13.916
unit like an aesterotitan tube.

0:01:14.416,0:01:16.291
But the first example we'll look at is a

0:01:16.291,0:01:17.833
super basic six-channel

0:01:17.833,0:01:19.416
dimmer that you want to be

0:01:19.458,0:01:21.833
tied into all one fixture. The example

0:01:21.833,0:01:23.000
that I think makes the

0:01:23.000,0:01:25.041
most sense is six space lights

0:01:25.125,0:01:27.500
overhead into a six-channel dimmer. So

0:01:27.500,0:01:28.750
basically we have six lights

0:01:28.750,0:01:30.000
overhead that we're probably

0:01:30.000,0:01:32.083
controlling altogether most of the time,

0:01:32.083,0:01:33.375
but there might be moments

0:01:33.375,0:01:34.375
where we want to dim them

0:01:34.375,0:01:36.208
individually. So making a profile for

0:01:36.208,0:01:37.791
this makes a lot of sense. So

0:01:37.791,0:01:38.833
let's take a look. We'll start

0:01:38.833,0:01:42.208
off by navigating to the patch tab and

0:01:42.208,0:01:44.166
going to add fixtures. And

0:01:44.166,0:01:45.583
here we'll now create new.

0:01:46.541,0:01:51.416
We can call this "6-by dimmer" and for

0:01:51.416,0:01:52.916
the mode we'll put 8-bit

0:01:52.916,0:01:54.333
because there are 8-bit dimmers

0:01:55.375,0:01:58.833
and 6-channel. And this

0:01:58.833,0:02:04.916
will be "8-bit 6-cell dimmer".

0:02:07.541,0:02:09.166
And we'll change the DMX footprint to be

0:02:09.166,0:02:11.791
6 and save. Now we're in

0:02:11.791,0:02:12.625
the fixture editor and the

0:02:12.708,0:02:14.250
first thing I'm going to do is actually

0:02:14.250,0:02:15.625
close out of here because

0:02:15.625,0:02:17.041
what I need to do is actually

0:02:17.125,0:02:19.916
change all of my modules to cells. Okay,

0:02:19.916,0:02:21.250
before we go any further, let's think

0:02:21.250,0:02:22.125
about this for a second.

0:02:22.416,0:02:24.250
We have a dimmer box with six channels

0:02:24.250,0:02:26.166
and each of those channels gets an

0:02:26.166,0:02:27.333
address. There's no master

0:02:27.333,0:02:29.041
channel that controls all of them, so we

0:02:29.041,0:02:30.250
need to tell blackout to

0:02:30.250,0:02:32.000
create that for us. Because when

0:02:32.000,0:02:33.500
you enter the address, that's just

0:02:33.500,0:02:34.875
controlling the first channel on the

0:02:34.875,0:02:36.000
dimmer. So let's say you put

0:02:36.000,0:02:37.833
an address 1, then address 1 is

0:02:37.833,0:02:39.791
controlling dimmer 1, address 2 is

0:02:39.791,0:02:40.708
controlling dimmer 2,

0:02:41.208,0:02:43.375
address 3 is controlling dimmer 3, and so

0:02:43.375,0:02:44.416
on and so forth, all the

0:02:44.416,0:02:46.000
way to 6. There's no address

0:02:46.000,0:02:47.666
anywhere in there that controls all of

0:02:47.666,0:02:48.458
them. So when you're

0:02:48.458,0:02:50.500
building a profile, you only define

0:02:50.625,0:02:53.291
actual parameters that your fixture has.

0:02:53.583,0:02:54.416
So I know that's a bit

0:02:54.416,0:02:55.875
confusing, so let me show you what I

0:02:55.875,0:02:57.916
mean. Here we have a head cell, but

0:02:57.916,0:02:58.916
blackout is going to

0:02:58.916,0:03:00.583
automatically create the head for us.

0:03:00.916,0:03:02.708
So we're going to tap the pencil here and

0:03:02.708,0:03:04.541
change this to a cell and

0:03:04.541,0:03:06.458
we'll relabel it "cell". Now we

0:03:06.500,0:03:08.041
can add our parameter, which is just

0:03:08.041,0:03:10.083
intensity. I'm hitting new channel right

0:03:10.083,0:03:11.375
here and I'm searching

0:03:11.458,0:03:13.375
for intensity. I can use this filter,

0:03:13.750,0:03:15.000
scroll down until I see

0:03:15.000,0:03:16.791
intensity and all the defaults here

0:03:16.791,0:03:20.166
are fine. Beautiful. Now we just have to

0:03:20.166,0:03:21.166
create five more modules.

0:03:21.500,0:03:23.041
I'll hit new module, I'll come

0:03:23.041,0:03:25.166
up to this list and select our cell and

0:03:25.166,0:03:27.083
then make sure I switch it to cell and

0:03:27.083,0:03:28.875
hit save. And I'll do

0:03:28.916,0:03:31.916
the same thing until I have six. Cell,

0:03:32.041,0:03:33.333
switch it to cell, save.

0:03:36.041,0:03:42.250
Okay, so now I have six cells that

0:03:42.250,0:03:44.000
all have their own intensity parameter.

0:03:44.208,0:03:45.541
All I have to do now is hit save and

0:03:45.541,0:03:46.916
patch it in. So I'll

0:03:46.916,0:03:50.041
hit save, hit patch. We'll keep the

0:03:50.041,0:03:52.708
defaults for now just to test it. Now if

0:03:52.708,0:03:53.625
I go to my fixture tab,

0:03:54.041,0:03:57.333
there we go. In the head, if I bring up

0:03:57.333,0:03:59.291
the intensity, it brings up all of them,

0:03:59.875,0:04:02.333
but I can clear out and then select just

0:04:02.333,0:04:04.583
one of them and bring that up and down.

0:04:09.125,0:04:11.250
Then I can grab the head and make all of

0:04:11.250,0:04:14.000
them full. I can grab the

0:04:14.000,0:04:17.750
head and go offset cells only

0:04:18.708,0:04:22.000
even and just turn the evens off. So

0:04:22.000,0:04:23.083
let's do one more together.

0:04:23.083,0:04:24.500
That's a very common fixture.

0:04:24.916,0:04:27.083
RGB pixel tape. The problem with RGB

0:04:27.083,0:04:28.875
pixel tape is each pixel

0:04:28.875,0:04:30.416
just has three parameters,

0:04:30.416,0:04:32.583
red, green, blue, there's no dimmer. So

0:04:32.583,0:04:34.125
it's similar. We have to

0:04:34.125,0:04:35.583
tell blackout to create a

0:04:35.583,0:04:38.291
dimmer to dim each channel using those

0:04:38.291,0:04:40.500
red, green, blue channels and create a

0:04:40.500,0:04:41.416
master dimmer for the

0:04:41.416,0:04:43.125
whole thing. So let's take a look at

0:04:43.125,0:04:45.083
that. Let's say we're doing three pixel

0:04:45.083,0:04:46.541
tape. We'll go to add

0:04:46.625,0:04:50.666
fixtures and create new and we'll call

0:04:50.666,0:04:54.666
this three pixel RGB

0:04:54.666,0:04:59.333
tape. We'll say RGB a bit.

0:05:00.541,0:05:01.708
You can look at some of our other

0:05:01.708,0:05:03.000
profiles to see what our naming

0:05:03.000,0:05:04.791
conventions are. And so I have

0:05:04.791,0:05:07.291
red, green, blue over three pixels. So

0:05:07.291,0:05:09.041
that will be a nine channel

0:05:09.041,0:05:11.583
footprint. We'll save that.

0:05:12.083,0:05:15.125
And I'll do the same thing by starting

0:05:15.125,0:05:16.041
off and turning this

0:05:16.041,0:05:17.625
into a cell. Because again,

0:05:17.916,0:05:20.291
address one on this pixel tape is red of

0:05:20.291,0:05:21.666
the first cell of the first

0:05:21.666,0:05:24.000
pixel address two is green of

0:05:24.000,0:05:26.166
the first cell. And then address three is

0:05:26.166,0:05:27.125
blue of the first cell.

0:05:27.541,0:05:29.416
And then address four is red

0:05:29.416,0:05:31.250
of the second cell and there are no

0:05:31.250,0:05:32.666
dimmers. So blackout will

0:05:32.666,0:05:33.958
just create those for us.

0:05:34.250,0:05:37.500
So we'll switch this to cell and I'll

0:05:37.500,0:05:39.250
call it pixel and save.

0:05:39.541,0:05:44.125
And save. And I'll do new channel select

0:05:44.125,0:05:46.666
parameter and I'll type in red.

0:05:48.791,0:05:52.291
Find red, save all the defaults for red

0:05:52.291,0:05:54.333
are perfect. So let's

0:05:54.333,0:05:56.291
save that new channel.

0:05:57.291,0:06:03.875
We'll search for blue. New

0:06:03.875,0:06:08.291
channel. I'll search for green.

0:06:14.625,0:06:16.833
And save. And this is our first pixel

0:06:16.833,0:06:19.125
done. So now we'll do

0:06:19.125,0:06:20.125
the same thing new module.

0:06:21.125,0:06:24.291
And I'll select the pixel. Make sure it's

0:06:24.291,0:06:27.250
a cell and save. And you can

0:06:27.250,0:06:28.541
see that starting at address

0:06:28.541,0:06:30.625
four. And then I'll do it one more time.

0:06:31.083,0:06:32.166
Select a module pixel,

0:06:33.291,0:06:35.083
change it to a cell and save.

0:06:36.833,0:06:38.916
So now let's patch this profile in and

0:06:38.916,0:06:40.875
take a look. I'll save it.

0:06:45.208,0:06:45.750
I'll patch it.

0:06:51.166,0:06:52.625
Just for visibility, I'll change the

0:06:52.625,0:06:57.208
color here to a red. So

0:06:57.208,0:06:58.458
now I can grab my fixture

0:06:59.208,0:07:02.833
and start dimming it up. And you can see

0:07:02.833,0:07:04.833
blackout built us a virtual dimmer.

0:07:05.750,0:07:08.333
And if I go into table view, I can see

0:07:08.333,0:07:09.541
what blackout's actually doing.

0:07:13.625,0:07:15.291
Blackout has just turned the red channel

0:07:15.291,0:07:16.958
on. If I saturated down,

0:07:21.208,0:07:22.666
we get all the channels at full because

0:07:22.666,0:07:24.875
that's white. And as I dim it down,

0:07:25.125,0:07:27.500
it dims the virtual dimmer. But if I

0:07:27.500,0:07:31.041
switch to my output value view state, I

0:07:31.041,0:07:32.125
can see that as I dim

0:07:32.125,0:07:34.291
down, this is what blackout is actually

0:07:34.291,0:07:36.083
doing. It's dimming down

0:07:36.083,0:07:38.458
the color channels. So that's

0:07:38.458,0:07:40.500
what a virtual dimmer does. So here I

0:07:40.500,0:07:41.291
have some pixel tape

0:07:41.291,0:07:44.000
connected to a DMX decoder. And if I

0:07:44.000,0:07:46.000
bring my virtual dimmer up, you can see

0:07:46.000,0:07:47.166
this whole section glows,

0:07:47.166,0:07:48.000
these are my three pixels.

0:07:48.500,0:07:51.708
And I can come in here and turn my two

0:07:51.708,0:07:53.333
end pixels off and just

0:07:53.333,0:07:55.041
get these on this tape.

0:07:55.333,0:07:58.333
One pixel is three diodes, and then I can

0:07:58.333,0:07:59.375
turn the second one on.

0:08:00.083,0:08:01.250
And then I can come in here,

0:08:01.583,0:08:04.250
saturate them up, move them around the

0:08:04.250,0:08:07.000
color wheel. And you can see it works

0:08:07.000,0:08:08.125
perfectly. So now I can

0:08:08.125,0:08:09.750
just tap the fixture, grab the whole

0:08:09.750,0:08:12.500
thing. Look at that, put them at full,

0:08:13.541,0:08:14.375
make them all the same

0:08:14.500,0:08:19.541
color. And there you go. That's how to

0:08:19.541,0:08:20.958
make a custom profile for

0:08:20.958,0:08:22.791
multi-cell units. Next in this

0:08:22.791,0:08:24.708
series, I'll be taking a look at moving

0:08:24.708,0:08:26.000
lights and more complex

0:08:26.000,0:08:27.500
fixtures. But let me know in the

0:08:27.500,0:08:29.000
comments what you want to see more of.

0:08:29.333,0:08:30.500
And of course, if you have

0:08:30.500,0:08:31.583
a fixture that you're unsure

0:08:31.583,0:08:33.541
about, let us know in the help center and

0:08:33.541,0:08:35.125
we'll get it in there for you. Okay,

0:08:35.291,0:08:36.333
that's it. See you next time.

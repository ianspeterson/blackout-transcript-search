This is the Cerise 4U by FTSLED

0:00:02.877,0:00:05.839
and it's absolutely
my favorite transmitter right now.

0:00:05.839,0:00:06.673
In fact it's

0:00:06.673,0:00:10.802
such a perfect match with Blackout
that I'm now selling these on my website.

0:00:10.885,0:00:15.849
The Cerise is what everyone hoped the 
Ratpack AKS would evolve to, as it requires

0:00:16.266,0:00:19.102
just one cable that both powers

0:00:19.102,0:00:22.105
it and gives it data over network.

0:00:22.564,0:00:26.443
It literally requires no setup
to get started using it with Blackout, yet

0:00:26.443,0:00:30.613
has some of the most powerful features
packed into it with its evolving web GUI.

0:00:31.197,0:00:32.157
Let's take a look.

0:00:42.042,0:00:43.668
There are three flavors of the Cerise.

0:00:43.668,0:00:46.504
The 1U, 2U, and 4U which correspond

0:00:46.504,0:00:49.299
to how many wireless universes
they can transmit.

0:00:49.299,0:00:53.178
However, the 2U and 4U both
have the ability to send an additional

0:00:53.178,0:00:58.475
four universes
via a wired RJ45 cable to a breakout box.

0:00:58.641,0:01:02.353
So if you're running a big rig
that gives you up to eight universes total

0:01:02.479,0:01:06.191
four over the air and four over wire,
all from one unit.

0:01:06.649,0:01:09.319
If that's not enough, both the 2U and 4U

0:01:09.319,0:01:12.614
can also take POE
or Power Over Ethernet.

0:01:12.781,0:01:13.865
so go ahead and skip

0:01:13.865,0:01:17.118
the separate power cable for those of us
running POE switches in our rigs.

0:01:17.118,0:01:20.205
But I think what's most catchy
about these transmitters is that they are

0:01:20.205,0:01:23.458
incredibly slim and light.

0:01:23.750,0:01:25.460
Just look at this.

0:01:25.460,0:01:27.045
The build quality is top notch.

0:01:27.045,0:01:31.007
It's a robust
all metal design with mounting

0:01:31.007,0:01:34.219
holes,
making it ridiculously versatile to rig.

0:01:34.302,0:01:37.097
Strap this onto the back of your iPad,
or screw it onto a cage,

0:01:37.097,0:01:39.224
and you are walking around
with a powerhouse

0:01:39.224,0:01:43.728
console with the ability to transmit up
to four universes wherever you go.

0:01:44.020,0:01:46.523
It makes lighting control a dream.

0:01:46.523,0:01:48.274
Now the coolest part.

0:01:48.274,0:01:52.946
All models can actually be powered
and fed data with just one cable.

0:01:53.321,0:01:55.949
So here we go. I'm running Blackout.

0:01:55.949,0:01:57.367
I plug this baby in,

0:01:57.367,0:02:00.370
I press link to link my fixtures and bam!

0:02:00.620,0:02:02.622
Up and running.

0:02:02.622,0:02:04.791
It doesn't get easier than that.

0:02:04.791,0:02:05.875
Now, of course it does

0:02:05.875,0:02:09.754
suck juice from the iPad, but now you only
have to monitor battery in one place.

0:02:09.754,0:02:14.259
And with the included Anker USB-C hub,
you can power the iPad either

0:02:14.259,0:02:16.845
with an external battery
or plug it into the wall

0:02:16.845,0:02:19.848
when you set it down
without breaking connection to the Cerise.

0:02:19.889,0:02:21.224
Remember the AKS?

0:02:21.224,0:02:23.977
If you were to shut it down
and then restart it,

0:02:23.977,0:02:26.980
it actually zeroed out all of the data,

0:02:26.980,0:02:29.315
and it would cause
your entire set to turn off

0:02:29.315,0:02:32.694
if you were within range of your light,
which was very problematic.

0:02:32.694,0:02:34.737
If you ever had this happen to you.

0:02:34.737,0:02:36.865
The Cerise doesn't do that.

0:02:36.865,0:02:40.869
I can unplug it, then plug it back in
and I'm back where I started.

0:02:41.369,0:02:42.662
Nothing to worry about.

0:02:42.662,0:02:46.416
Plus, it boots in roughly seven seconds,
which is five seconds

0:02:46.416,0:02:48.334
faster than the Skycast-C.

0:02:48.334,0:02:51.045
It doesn't seem like much,
but it can make a big difference

0:02:51.045,0:02:52.922
in those time critical situations.

0:02:52.922,0:02:55.758
If you've ever had to juggle
an iPad power situation,

0:02:55.758,0:02:57.260
come on, we've all been there.

0:02:57.260,0:02:58.720
If we dive into the web GUI,

0:02:58.720,0:03:02.432
the easiest way to get there from an iPad
is just go to your network settings

0:03:02.640,0:03:05.977
and look at the name of the device,
which shows you its IP.

0:03:06.311,0:03:09.564
It will also give the device
you are connected to an IP

0:03:09.564,0:03:12.901
one digit higher than what
the node is currently set at.

0:03:13.151,0:03:14.444
So here I'll just copy

0:03:14.444,0:03:17.780
and paste this in a web browser
and now change the number to one less.

0:03:17.780,0:03:19.449
And now you can see the web GUI.

0:03:19.449,0:03:23.453
It's even easier if you plug this
into a computer with a USB-C cable,

0:03:23.453,0:03:26.539
because you get this sleek pop up
that takes you right there.

0:03:26.915,0:03:28.708
Besides the traditional device and network

0:03:28.708,0:03:32.295
settings, you have full customization
of each universe output.

0:03:32.754,0:03:35.882
Here, I can change the universe,
including selecting a merge mode.

0:03:35.882,0:03:40.053
If using more than one source,
I can link or unlink fixtures per antenna

0:03:40.261,0:03:43.264
and even set the linking key per antenna.

0:03:43.473,0:03:47.227
Now remember Lumen Radio has locked down
CRMX squared,

0:03:47.518,0:03:51.689
so no one can transmit multiple universes
over a single antenna.

0:03:51.814,0:03:54.817
But everyone can still use
the linking key.

0:03:55.318,0:03:59.489
Here you are able to set a different
linking key per antenna.

0:03:59.906,0:04:04.535
And if you're not familiar with what
this linking key is, it's the nice ability

0:04:04.535,0:04:09.165
to link fixtures to an antenna
by simply inputting this key

0:04:09.165,0:04:13.294
into the light fixture itself,
which can be super handy

0:04:13.294,0:04:16.339
when you are batch configuring
a bunch of lights like Asteras.

0:04:16.339,0:04:19.759
No more having to carry the transmitter
with you in order to link.

0:04:20.009,0:04:23.054
You can set this in the fixture
if you're on the reading crew

0:04:23.054,0:04:24.264
and then when your main unit

0:04:24.264,0:04:28.059
comes with their transmitter with the same
linking key, you're good to go

0:04:28.059,0:04:29.852
because the lights
will automatically search

0:04:29.852,0:04:33.273
for that transmitter
with that linking key and connect up.

0:04:33.523,0:04:36.776
So each antenna has to have its own
linking key in order for this

0:04:36.776,0:04:39.779
to work on third party products
like the Cerise.

0:04:40.071,0:04:42.115
And when you pair to this,
you just make sure

0:04:42.115,0:04:46.077
that you are in universe
A connecting via regular CRMX.

0:04:46.536,0:04:50.873
Only the Stardust can support a single
linking key across all antennas

0:04:51.082,0:04:56.713
with CRMX squared, so that's an incredibly
convenient feature on the Cerise.

0:04:56.879,0:04:59.716
The little megaphone icon
is where you can set the transmit power,

0:04:59.716,0:05:03.052
and the Bluetooth icon
allows you to enable or disable Bluetooth,

0:05:03.428,0:05:07.015
allowing you to connect up
to each CRMX chip with LumenRadio CRMX

0:05:07.223,0:05:10.101
toolbox app in case you need to update it.

0:05:10.101,0:05:12.562
If you look at the top,
you can go to the console tab.

0:05:12.562,0:05:14.939
If you need to just flash out a few things
manually.

0:05:14.939,0:05:18.026
The spectrum tab to see if you are getting
any wireless interference.

0:05:18.067,0:05:20.361
And the help tab for quick access to help.

0:05:20.361,0:05:22.113
Although it's not officially released yet.

0:05:22.113,0:05:25.450
RDM support is on the way,
and it brings some exciting capabilities

0:05:25.616,0:05:27.118
with the upcoming RDM tab.

0:05:27.118,0:05:28.494
You'll be able to view fixture data

0:05:28.494,0:05:32.749
like temperature, battery life, and other
key stats directly within the web GUI.

0:05:32.999,0:05:36.544
Even more useful, RDM
lets you remotely change the DMX address

0:05:36.544,0:05:38.129
or mode of a fixture.

0:05:38.129,0:05:40.590
No need to walk over or climb a ladder.

0:05:40.590,0:05:41.799
It's another step towards

0:05:41.799,0:05:45.595
faster workflows, smarter control,
and a more efficient lighting experience.

0:05:45.636,0:05:47.805
So stay tuned for that release.

0:05:47.805,0:05:51.100
The Cerise 4U isn't just
my favorite transmitter right now.

0:05:51.434,0:05:53.644
It's what the AKS should have become.

0:05:53.644,0:05:56.689
It's rugged, reliable, and ridiculously

0:05:56.689,0:05:59.692
easy to use in a very compact size.

0:05:59.734,0:06:03.488
You can get up to eight universes
from a single unit, seamless

0:06:03.488,0:06:08.785
Blackout integration with zero setup
and a slick web GUI that's actually useful.

0:06:08.868,0:06:12.455
I'm now selling the Cerise lineup
directly on Blackoutâ€™s website

0:06:12.455,0:06:15.458
because I believe in this product
that much.

0:06:15.458,0:06:18.127
The creator, Charlie, genuinely cares

0:06:18.127,0:06:21.130
about delivering something of real value
to working professionals.

0:06:21.172,0:06:24.300
If you're serious about wireless control
and want a rock solid

0:06:24.300,0:06:27.303
upgrade to your setup, this is it.

0:06:27.553,0:06:28.930
Hey, thanks for watching.

0:06:28.930,0:06:30.431
Tell me what you think about the Cerise

0:06:30.431,0:06:32.767
in the comments below,
and I'll catch you in the next video.

0:00:00.000,0:00:01.166
We've got a new update out.

0:00:01.166,0:00:04.250
So let's slow down and talk about it.

0:00:04.625,0:00:08.000
as always, there's a lot in this update,
so see the full release notes below.

0:00:08.000,0:00:11.125
But the big new feature
that we're going to talk about is

0:00:11.125,0:00:14.458
you can finally put affect
speed on faders.

0:00:14.500,0:00:16.333
So let's take a look at that. Okay.

0:00:16.333,0:00:17.500
So let's take a look at this

0:00:17.500,0:00:20.666
brand new feature
by making an effect on the Helios tube.

0:00:20.833,0:00:22.083
I'll grab my Helios tube.

0:00:22.083,0:00:25.708
I'll go offset sell, sell
only to select just the cells,

0:00:26.000,0:00:28.875
and then I'll hit record effect.

0:00:28.875,0:00:31.875
And I'll call this Chase.

0:00:32.750,0:00:36.416
Okay, so if I hit play on this
Helios chase, you'll see.

0:00:36.416,0:00:39.000
We get a chase across this Helios tube.

0:00:39.000,0:00:43.666
But this is way too slow, and I want to
dynamically speed it up or slow it down.

0:00:43.708,0:00:44.541
How do I do that?

0:00:44.541,0:00:48.416
Well, I can put speed on a fader,
so I'll go to my fader

0:00:48.416,0:00:51.708
page now
and I'll load any of these empty faders.

0:00:51.708,0:00:56.916
Let's take this one in the middle and
I'll go to effect and select the effect.

0:00:56.916,0:00:59.750
In this case
the chase that I want to slow down.

0:00:59.750,0:01:04.416
And then I can come over here
and switch it from master to affect speed.

0:01:04.541,0:01:07.000
It's worth it to know if I select master.

0:01:07.000,0:01:10.750
That's going to control both the intensity
and the speed together.

0:01:11.000,0:01:15.208
You might want this if you just want to
shut off and turn on an effect entirely.

0:01:15.416,0:01:18.416
most instances,
I just want to control the effect speed.

0:01:18.458,0:01:21.333
I like using inhibitors
to control the intensity.

0:01:21.333,0:01:23.791
you'll see here
I can set the max speed percentage.

0:01:23.791,0:01:26.708
I found 500% is great. So we'll keep that.

0:01:26.708,0:01:29.791
and then the last thing
I'll do before exiting this menu is add

0:01:29.791,0:01:33.125
one of our new buttons,
which is the speed 1 to 1 button.

0:01:33.208,0:01:35.541
that's going to reset the speed 1 to 1.

0:01:35.541,0:01:38.541
So now I'll hit save on the button
and I'll save the menu.

0:01:38.916,0:01:40.416
And here's our speed fader.

0:01:40.416,0:01:42.125
You can see my chase stopped.

0:01:42.125,0:01:44.250
And that's because my faders at zero.

0:01:44.250,0:01:49.291
Now if I start bringing my fader up,
you can see the chase starts again.

0:01:49.500,0:01:52.916
and if I go all the way to 500%, it
speeds up to the max.

0:01:53.083,0:01:55.708
Now you can either change the max
speed percentage

0:01:55.708,0:01:57.583
or just make your effect faster.

0:01:57.583,0:02:00.583
So if I go back into my effects menu,

0:02:00.625,0:02:03.250
I can change the total time to one second.

0:02:03.250,0:02:05.666
Now this is going a lot faster.

0:02:05.666,0:02:10.416
So I'm going to hit my speed 1 to 1 button
and see where my base speed is.

0:02:10.833,0:02:14.250
You can see that feels pretty nice
if I bring the fader all the way down.

0:02:14.416,0:02:16.958
It will stop the effect
because the speed is zero.

0:02:16.958,0:02:22.208
That's pretty cool Now just add a Midi
fader into the mix, and it's a party. We.

0:02:22.333,0:02:25.041
To see everything that's new in 2.4.6.

0:02:25.041,0:02:27.041

0:02:27.041,0:02:30.875

0:02:30.875,0:02:31.833
come in as red.

0:02:31.833,0:02:33.958
There's a lot to love
and we have a lot more coming.

0:02:33.958,0:02:37.000

the comments what you want to see more of.

0:02:37.000,0:02:37.833
I'll see you next time.

0:09:32.416,0:09:33.958
Don't put this in the video.

0:09:33.958,0:09:35.083
Just my cursor.

0:09:35.083,0:09:36.958
Okay, I'll start that over
because I fucked up.

0:09:36.958,0:09:40.041
Fuck. Okay. Okay. Don't use that.

0:09:40.208,0:09:42.250
Okay.

0:09:42.250,0:09:44.791
you can see
I get this chase on my Helios tube.

0:09:44.791,0:09:46.958
That's way too bright. Jeez.

0:09:46.958,0:09:49.000
Oh, fuck me.

0:09:49.000,0:09:50.375
Will slow that down.

0:09:50.375,0:09:52.166
Now and just start it here.

0:00:00.250,0:00:01.458
Hey everyone, today we're going to be

0:00:01.458,0:00:02.916
talking about the brand new

0:00:02.916,0:00:06.041
encoder page in Blackout 2.4.

0:00:06.041,0:00:07.791
Now this is a big update for us. We

0:00:07.791,0:00:09.333
debuted at Cinegear and as

0:00:09.333,0:00:10.458
you probably already know,

0:00:10.541,0:00:12.666
we also launched the Astera integration.

0:00:13.166,0:00:14.166
I'm not going to cover that

0:00:14.166,0:00:15.791
here because Jeff made a great

0:00:15.791,0:00:17.875
full walkthrough, so check his video out.

0:00:17.875,0:00:18.500
The link will be in the

0:00:18.500,0:00:19.833
description. Today I'm going

0:00:19.833,0:00:21.583
to be talking about the other feature we

0:00:21.583,0:00:23.208
introduced, which is the brand new

0:00:23.208,0:00:25.000
encoder page and Stream Deck

0:00:25.000,0:00:26.833
integration. So we're here in Blackout

0:00:26.833,0:00:27.875
and you'll see down at the

0:00:27.875,0:00:28.958
bottom I have the brand new

0:00:28.958,0:00:31.333
encoders tab. The encoder tab is

0:00:31.333,0:00:32.250
available if you've

0:00:32.250,0:00:33.750
purchased the MIDI upgrade, which is

0:00:33.750,0:00:35.708
available for both our subscription users

0:00:35.708,0:00:37.125
and our perpetual license

0:00:37.125,0:00:39.000
users as an additional add-on.

0:00:39.541,0:00:41.291
So once you've purchased the MIDI add-on,

0:00:41.291,0:00:42.125
you'll see your encoder

0:00:42.125,0:00:43.458
tab down here at the bottom.

0:00:44.000,0:00:46.166
I can click on it and I'm taken to this

0:00:46.166,0:00:47.791
blank encoder page. And here

0:00:47.791,0:00:49.500
you can set up per parameter

0:00:49.583,0:00:51.750
encoder so you can grab one fixture or

0:00:51.750,0:00:53.541
multiple fixtures and adjust

0:00:53.541,0:00:55.166
the same parameter on all of

0:00:55.208,0:00:58.041
them. So here's how to set that up. I can

0:00:58.041,0:00:59.000
come up here and click

0:00:59.000,0:01:00.958
edit and you'll see all the

0:01:00.958,0:01:02.666
encoders change and allow me to pick

0:01:02.666,0:01:04.291
their parameter. So I'll

0:01:04.291,0:01:05.208
come over here to the first

0:01:05.208,0:01:08.166
one and make this intensity. I'll come

0:01:08.166,0:01:09.333
over to this one and

0:01:09.333,0:01:10.291
make a color temperature.

0:01:11.041,0:01:13.000
I'll come over to this one. I'll make it

0:01:13.000,0:01:14.958
crossfade and I'll come over

0:01:14.958,0:01:16.000
to this one and make it tint.

0:01:16.541,0:01:18.000
That's all I need for now. So I'll go

0:01:18.000,0:01:18.791
ahead and click save.

0:01:18.791,0:01:23.166
And if you look at the top, we also have

0:01:23.166,0:01:24.791
pages in our encoders tab,

0:01:25.000,0:01:26.375
just like in the faders tab.

0:01:26.875,0:01:28.666
So here you can have up to a hundred

0:01:28.666,0:01:32.375
available encoders. If I click in the

0:01:32.375,0:01:33.458
center of an encoder,

0:01:33.458,0:01:35.666
I can change it from fine, super fine and

0:01:35.666,0:01:37.166
coarse. Definitely like to

0:01:37.166,0:01:38.291
keep color temperature on

0:01:38.291,0:01:40.583
coarse. So you can select different

0:01:40.583,0:01:41.958
adjustment levels for

0:01:41.958,0:01:43.916
different encoders. At the bottom,

0:01:44.000,0:01:45.875
you can send an encoder to its minimum,

0:01:46.291,0:01:48.916
its maximum, and its home. And of course,

0:01:49.125,0:01:51.125
all of these buttons are MIDI learnable.

0:01:51.416,0:01:52.125
Pro tip, but you can

0:01:52.125,0:01:53.291
actually MIDI learn the

0:01:53.291,0:01:55.083
MIDI learn button. So it makes mapping

0:01:55.083,0:01:56.333
out your encoders even

0:01:56.333,0:01:57.833
faster because with the click of a

0:01:57.833,0:02:00.833
button, I can be in MIDI learn mode. To

0:02:00.833,0:02:01.916
set that up, go into link

0:02:01.916,0:02:03.541
status, connect to device,

0:02:04.083,0:02:05.958
and click MIDI learn. And you'll see I

0:02:05.958,0:02:07.666
can click MIDI learn again to map it.

0:02:08.416,0:02:10.291
I have it mapped to my stream deck, which

0:02:10.291,0:02:11.166
I'll show you in a minute.

0:02:11.583,0:02:13.291
So now that I'm in MIDI learn,

0:02:13.541,0:02:15.625
all I have to do is click on an encoder.

0:02:16.041,0:02:16.875
And then I just have to

0:02:16.875,0:02:18.791
twist an infinite encoder on my

0:02:18.791,0:02:20.666
MIDI device that I want to map there. If

0:02:20.666,0:02:21.833
I click in the center, I

0:02:21.833,0:02:23.625
can map the adjustment level,

0:02:24.708,0:02:28.083
as well as the minimum, home, and max

0:02:28.083,0:02:30.833
buttons. Now back in the

0:02:30.833,0:02:32.416
fixture page, all I have to do

0:02:32.500,0:02:35.750
is grab a bunch of fixtures. And as I

0:02:35.750,0:02:37.000
move the encoder, the

0:02:37.000,0:02:39.833
intensity changes. Of course,

0:02:39.833,0:02:44.041
this works for tint and color

0:02:44.041,0:02:46.250
temperature. You'll also see

0:02:46.250,0:02:47.458
at the top of each encoder,

0:02:47.458,0:02:49.291
it gives you a readout of the level you

0:02:49.291,0:02:50.416
set. So that's the encoder

0:02:50.416,0:02:51.791
page. Let's check out this

0:02:51.833,0:02:54.416
other tab for our stream deck. Stream

0:02:54.416,0:02:56.416
decks come with a USB A plug.

0:02:56.416,0:02:57.708
So you'll need a hub that has

0:02:57.708,0:03:00.500
a USB A port to plug into your iPad. The

0:03:00.500,0:03:01.250
first time you connect

0:03:01.250,0:03:02.500
your stream deck, you'll need

0:03:02.500,0:03:04.458
to go to the app store and you'll need to

0:03:04.458,0:03:07.000
download SD connect. All you

0:03:07.000,0:03:08.458
have to do is open the app and

0:03:08.500,0:03:10.333
follow the prompts. And then once you've

0:03:10.333,0:03:12.208
set that up, you just need to keep SD

0:03:12.208,0:03:13.333
connect on your iPad

0:03:13.500,0:03:15.416
and you never have to do anything with it

0:03:15.416,0:03:16.666
again. You never have to

0:03:16.666,0:03:18.125
open it again. You just have to

0:03:18.125,0:03:19.666
allow the permissions once and then

0:03:19.666,0:03:20.791
you're done. Now back in

0:03:20.791,0:03:22.291
blackout in the stream deck page,

0:03:22.416,0:03:24.583
this is where we can configure how the

0:03:24.583,0:03:25.875
buttons look right in

0:03:25.875,0:03:28.041
blackout. So you'll see, I already

0:03:28.041,0:03:30.291
have mine set up, but you can just click

0:03:30.291,0:03:32.250
on a button. You can change the

0:03:32.250,0:03:33.750
background to any color

0:03:33.750,0:03:36.458
you want. You can click here and change

0:03:36.458,0:03:38.666
it to an icon and you

0:03:38.666,0:03:40.208
can even give icons colors.

0:03:41.208,0:03:43.625
So I don't know, make that blue. And then

0:03:43.625,0:03:45.250
down here you can change the text.

0:03:49.833,0:03:50.500
And then up here you

0:03:50.500,0:03:51.625
can change the text color.

0:03:55.833,0:03:57.333
Once you've set up the appearance of the

0:03:57.333,0:03:58.458
buttons the way you want,

0:03:58.458,0:03:59.500
all you have to do is press

0:03:59.541,0:04:01.333
midi learn and learn the buttons to

0:04:01.333,0:04:02.291
whatever you want them to

0:04:02.291,0:04:04.041
correspond to. So here I can click

0:04:04.041,0:04:05.958
a macro and learn it right to the stream

0:04:05.958,0:04:08.500
deck. Coming soon are

0:04:08.500,0:04:10.208
stream deck pages and support

0:04:10.208,0:04:11.708
for different models of stream deck.

0:04:12.041,0:04:13.458
That's pretty much it. Not a lot of

0:04:13.458,0:04:14.625
explaining to do because

0:04:14.625,0:04:17.000
it's so intuitive and easy to set up the

0:04:17.000,0:04:18.208
stream deck and your

0:04:18.208,0:04:20.125
encoders page. If you like using

0:04:20.125,0:04:21.583
hardware with blackout, you're going to

0:04:21.583,0:04:23.291
love this update. As always,

0:04:23.291,0:04:24.000
let me know in the comments

0:04:24.083,0:04:25.250
what you want to see more of

0:04:25.250,0:04:26.208
and I'll see you next time.

0:00:00.000,0:00:02.333
So today I want to use my Cerise and my

0:00:02.333,0:00:04.166
ART7 Wi-Fi in Blackout.

0:00:04.458,0:00:05.416
Let's learn about it.

0:00:05.416,0:00:06.541
So in this video, we're going to talk

0:00:06.541,0:00:07.791
about using my Cerise

0:00:07.791,0:00:08.916
connected to my iPad

0:00:08.916,0:00:11.916
through the USB C cable to transmit CRM X

0:00:11.916,0:00:14.375
to all my lights, while also having the

0:00:14.375,0:00:17.125
ART7 connected to my iPad with Wi-Fi

0:00:17.125,0:00:18.625
to check on my Asteras.

0:00:19.083,0:00:21.000
These two devices are my favorite combo

0:00:21.000,0:00:21.833
right now in Blackout.

0:00:22.208,0:00:24.166
But you can do this with any transmitter

0:00:24.166,0:00:25.375
that you can hardline

0:00:25.375,0:00:27.458
via USB C into your iPad.

0:00:27.500,0:00:29.625
So the Rat Pack AKS, the Rat Pack

0:00:29.625,0:00:31.791
satellite, really any transmitter with an

0:00:31.791,0:00:33.958
ethernet port will work like this, too.

0:00:34.250,0:00:35.833
Before we get started, I just want to say

0:00:35.833,0:00:37.750
in this video, we're only using the ART7

0:00:37.750,0:00:39.916
Wi-Fi box for the Astera

0:00:39.916,0:00:40.958
integration in Blackout.

0:00:41.416,0:00:42.916
We are not using it as a

0:00:42.916,0:00:44.541
node in addition to our Cerise.

0:00:44.833,0:00:46.666
You can use your ART7 as an

0:00:46.666,0:00:48.666
additional universe, but that requires

0:00:48.750,0:00:49.833
networking it together

0:00:49.833,0:00:51.166
with your other transmitter.

0:00:51.166,0:00:51.875
And I won't be

0:00:51.875,0:00:53.000
showing that in this video.

0:00:53.333,0:00:54.083
So without further

0:00:54.083,0:00:55.375
ado, let's get started.

0:00:55.541,0:00:57.083
Okay. The first thing I'm going to do is

0:00:57.083,0:00:58.833
open Safari and go to

0:00:58.833,0:01:00.208
the IP address of my

0:01:00.208,0:01:01.958
series. Now you're welcome to keep the

0:01:01.958,0:01:03.208
default IP address that

0:01:03.208,0:01:04.166
the Cerise ships with.

0:01:04.291,0:01:06.375
I found that I get better results using

0:01:06.375,0:01:07.666
this IP address scheme.

0:01:08.000,0:01:09.041
If you're not comfortable with

0:01:09.041,0:01:10.125
networking, you can just

0:01:10.125,0:01:11.833
leave them alone or you can

0:01:11.833,0:01:13.708
copy mine. Just note that if you change

0:01:13.708,0:01:15.041
the IP address of the

0:01:15.041,0:01:16.125
Cerise, that's going

0:01:16.125,0:01:18.083
to be the new number that you type into

0:01:18.083,0:01:19.708
the web browser to get to the Cerise

0:01:19.791,0:01:20.833
configuration page.

0:01:21.250,0:01:22.833
I did want to show off this page because

0:01:22.833,0:01:23.500
it is really

0:01:23.500,0:01:24.708
important that you change set

0:01:24.833,0:01:27.250
as default gateway to no. You can do

0:01:27.250,0:01:28.458
this by clicking the pencil.

0:01:28.916,0:01:30.500
And this is how you change all of your

0:01:30.500,0:01:32.958
settings and making sure this is off and

0:01:32.958,0:01:34.041
then clicking the checkbox.

0:01:34.500,0:01:36.000
Then the web page will prompt you to

0:01:36.000,0:01:37.291
reset and you can reset

0:01:37.291,0:01:38.125
the device from there.

0:01:38.375,0:01:39.916
The page will also tell you that if you

0:01:39.916,0:01:40.541
change the IP

0:01:40.541,0:01:41.541
address, you'll have to type

0:01:41.541,0:01:42.750
in that IP address to

0:01:42.750,0:01:43.500
get back to the page.

0:01:43.791,0:01:45.541
With that done, let's set up our ART7

0:01:45.541,0:01:47.291
Wi-Fi box, a

0:01:47.291,0:01:48.583
short press and hold of the

0:01:48.583,0:01:49.833
power button turns it on.

0:01:50.166,0:01:51.333
Now let's navigate to the

0:01:51.333,0:01:53.166
Astera Next app in the Astera page.

0:01:53.333,0:01:54.791
I'll go manage Bluetooth bridges.

0:01:55.208,0:01:57.291
I'll hit the plus sign and I'll click

0:01:57.291,0:01:59.125
this top option for the ART7.

0:01:59.291,0:02:00.500
You'll see it pop up here

0:02:00.500,0:02:01.708
and I'll hit tap to bond.

0:02:01.916,0:02:02.708
You'll notice here it

0:02:02.708,0:02:03.958
says connected via Bluetooth.

0:02:04.291,0:02:06.291
When using the Astera app, I always

0:02:06.291,0:02:08.000
recommend connecting via Bluetooth.

0:02:08.333,0:02:09.250
That way you can save the

0:02:09.250,0:02:10.750
Wi-Fi features for Blackout.

0:02:11.125,0:02:12.083
The other thing I want to

0:02:12.083,0:02:13.958
note here is my firmware version.

0:02:14.125,0:02:16.166
You have to be on five point fifteen

0:02:16.166,0:02:18.458
point one three seven to use the Blackout

0:02:18.500,0:02:20.375
integration. If you're not on this

0:02:20.375,0:02:21.458
firmware, check out my

0:02:21.458,0:02:22.250
Facebook post where I

0:02:22.333,0:02:23.291
explain how to update.

0:02:23.541,0:02:24.750
You'll come to this side menu.

0:02:25.333,0:02:28.500
You'll scroll down to app settings, go to

0:02:28.500,0:02:30.666
lights background update and press and

0:02:30.666,0:02:33.625
hold this refresh icon and

0:02:33.625,0:02:35.041
type in the code Blackout.

0:02:35.708,0:02:37.083
I've already done this so I can't show

0:02:37.083,0:02:38.125
you much more than this.

0:02:38.500,0:02:40.875
But once you hit OK, you'll be prompted

0:02:40.875,0:02:42.583
to update with a custom firmware.

0:02:42.958,0:02:43.875
And that is five point

0:02:43.875,0:02:45.166
fifteen point one three seven.

0:02:45.416,0:02:47.416
After you've updated the firmware, reboot

0:02:47.416,0:02:49.375
the box and you can keep going with us.

0:02:49.708,0:02:51.291
So now that we're on the right firmware,

0:02:51.958,0:02:52.750
I'm going to hit this

0:02:52.750,0:02:54.083
arrow to go into the

0:02:54.083,0:02:56.958
boxes settings or go to Wi-Fi settings

0:02:56.958,0:03:00.500
and I'll turn access point on and join

0:03:00.541,0:03:03.041
network off and then I'll click done.

0:03:03.333,0:03:05.250
At this point, I recommend rebooting the

0:03:05.250,0:03:06.916
ART7. Press and hold the power button

0:03:07.125,0:03:08.375
and it'll turn off.

0:03:09.000,0:03:11.250
Yep. And then short press and hold.

0:03:11.375,0:03:12.250
It'll turn back on.

0:03:12.708,0:03:14.541
Now we're all done with the Astera app.

0:03:14.791,0:03:16.625
Here I am in Blackout and you can see in

0:03:16.625,0:03:18.750
link status I'm connected via Ethernet.

0:03:19.041,0:03:20.000
I'll click link status

0:03:20.000,0:03:21.625
and go to connect to Astera.

0:03:22.375,0:03:24.875
I'll add a new Astera box and make sure

0:03:24.875,0:03:27.000
I'm on connect via Wi-Fi access point.

0:03:27.375,0:03:28.000
Again, this is the

0:03:28.000,0:03:29.166
beauty of this whole setup.

0:03:29.166,0:03:30.625
I'm connected to my CRM X

0:03:30.625,0:03:32.500
transmitter via Ethernet.

0:03:32.791,0:03:33.916
This USB cable.

0:03:34.125,0:03:35.375
But I can also connect to

0:03:35.375,0:03:37.416
my ART7 via its Wi-Fi.

0:03:37.416,0:03:38.833
So here we'll put in the pairing pin,

0:03:38.833,0:03:39.916
which you can see on a

0:03:39.916,0:03:40.916
sticker on the back of

0:03:40.916,0:03:42.833
your box. Blackout will then prompt you

0:03:42.833,0:03:43.833
to join the network.

0:03:43.833,0:03:44.916
I'll click join and it will

0:03:44.916,0:03:46.125
ask you to pick a radio pin.

0:03:46.500,0:03:47.958
I'll use four eights and

0:03:47.958,0:03:49.333
I'll select US Australia.

0:03:49.791,0:03:51.291
Then I'll hit connect and you can see

0:03:51.291,0:03:53.416
instantly my ART7 pops up.

0:03:53.625,0:03:54.791
So let's test this out.

0:03:55.083,0:03:56.500
I'll go into patch add

0:03:56.500,0:03:58.291
fixtures, go to the cloud database.

0:03:58.666,0:04:01.458
I'll search for a Helios tube series.

0:04:01.791,0:04:03.791
Let's grab a bunch of pixels, do like

0:04:03.791,0:04:06.083
eight pixels and I'll do something crazy.

0:04:06.083,0:04:07.291
Like mode 140.

0:04:07.541,0:04:08.375
We'll patch that in.

0:04:08.583,0:04:09.625
I'll use my white remote

0:04:09.625,0:04:11.000
to blue mode my Helios.

0:04:13.416,0:04:13.916
There it goes.

0:04:14.041,0:04:14.583
Oh my gosh.

0:04:15.416,0:04:16.500
At least it's on key side.

0:04:17.666,0:04:19.166
Now that it's in blue mode, I'll go to

0:04:19.166,0:04:20.750
link status, connect

0:04:20.750,0:04:22.166
to a star and I'll hit

0:04:22.166,0:04:23.250
pair with lights and

0:04:23.250,0:04:24.500
just like that, it connects.

0:04:24.916,0:04:26.416
Now in the patch, I'll hit the Astara

0:04:26.416,0:04:27.875
logo and I'll hit send

0:04:27.875,0:04:29.041
to send it the data for

0:04:29.041,0:04:29.583
the patch.

0:04:29.583,0:04:30.500
I'll hit enter on the

0:04:30.500,0:04:32.208
light and now it's patched.

0:04:32.666,0:04:36.625
I'll give it a little test to one at 20.

0:04:38.333,0:04:39.291
Looks like it works to me.

0:04:39.625,0:04:41.416
And then as you can see up at the top, I

0:04:41.416,0:04:42.333
have the battery life.

0:04:42.541,0:04:44.625
If I click the Astera logo, I can see the

0:04:44.625,0:04:45.500
exact battery life

0:04:45.500,0:04:46.708
and I can change any of

0:04:46.708,0:04:47.541
the settings I want.

0:04:48.250,0:04:48.958
I can flash it white.

0:04:49.875,0:04:52.541
I can flash it cyan and I can take back

0:04:52.541,0:04:53.791
over with DMX control.

0:04:54.166,0:04:55.916
So as you can see, the ART7 and the

0:04:55.916,0:04:57.375
Cerise play great together.

0:04:57.708,0:04:59.708
The only other tip I have for you is the

0:04:59.708,0:05:02.708
Cerise is really strong and it broadcasts

0:05:02.833,0:05:05.750
CRMX on 2.4 gigahertz, which is what the

0:05:05.750,0:05:07.375
ART7 uses for its wifi.

0:05:07.750,0:05:09.416
So I recommend having them

0:05:09.416,0:05:10.958
spaced apart a little right now.

0:05:10.958,0:05:12.500
They're about a foot away from each other

0:05:12.500,0:05:13.708
and it's working great.

0:05:13.958,0:05:15.791
So do your own testing, but that's my

0:05:15.791,0:05:17.083
only other little recommendation.

0:05:17.500,0:05:18.750
So that's how to set this all up.

0:05:18.958,0:05:20.125
Let me know in the comments what you want

0:05:20.125,0:05:21.458
to see more of, and I'll see you next time.

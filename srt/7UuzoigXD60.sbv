0:00:01.000,0:00:02.875
Hey look at that. I can control blackout

0:00:02.875,0:00:04.708
from my phone. You may

0:00:04.708,0:00:06.250
already be familiar with MIDI

0:00:06.250,0:00:08.458
control in blackout, but blackout also

0:00:08.458,0:00:10.125
supports OSC, which stands

0:00:10.125,0:00:11.875
for open sound control and

0:00:11.958,0:00:14.458
isn't limited to the 8 bits that MIDI is.

0:00:14.791,0:00:15.708
Open sound control is

0:00:15.708,0:00:17.333
awesome because a wide range

0:00:17.333,0:00:19.416
of hardware and software supports it and

0:00:19.416,0:00:20.375
it allows for custom

0:00:20.375,0:00:21.666
messages so the possibilities

0:00:21.875,0:00:24.041
are endless. In this video I'm going to

0:00:24.041,0:00:25.708
show you how to set up OSC

0:00:25.708,0:00:27.625
with an app called Touch OSC.

0:00:27.666,0:00:30.250
Touch OSC is free on your computer so you

0:00:30.250,0:00:31.375
can download it there and

0:00:31.375,0:00:32.416
start playing around with

0:00:32.416,0:00:34.125
it and follow along with the video, but

0:00:34.125,0:00:34.833
everything we're going to

0:00:34.833,0:00:36.166
learn about the connection setup

0:00:36.166,0:00:39.333
translates to any OSC device or software

0:00:39.333,0:00:40.958
you're going to use. You

0:00:40.958,0:00:42.250
can even go crazy and start

0:00:42.250,0:00:44.666
hooking up game controllers or building

0:00:44.666,0:00:47.000
your own faders. So the first thing

0:00:47.000,0:00:47.583
you're going to want

0:00:47.583,0:00:50.291
to do is check that blackout and your OSC

0:00:50.291,0:00:51.375
device are on the same

0:00:51.375,0:00:52.916
network. I can come up here to

0:00:52.916,0:00:55.708
link status in blackout and I can see my

0:00:55.708,0:00:57.666
network here and then on my

0:00:57.666,0:01:00.041
phone I can see that I'm on

0:01:00.041,0:01:02.583
the same network. I'm on Android so if I

0:01:02.583,0:01:04.083
click this little wheel I

0:01:04.083,0:01:05.166
can come down here to view

0:01:05.166,0:01:07.458
more and see my IP address. This will be

0:01:07.458,0:01:09.000
useful for later so I'm going to keep

0:01:09.000,0:01:10.000
this number memorized.

0:01:10.375,0:01:12.666
Then back in blackout I'm going to

0:01:12.666,0:01:16.583
connect device and go to the OSC tab. The

0:01:16.583,0:01:17.416
first thing I'm going

0:01:17.416,0:01:20.250
to do is click on OSC documentation. If

0:01:20.250,0:01:21.000
you're connected to the

0:01:21.000,0:01:22.750
internet you'll be taken to the

0:01:22.750,0:01:25.041
blackout web page where you can see all

0:01:25.041,0:01:26.500
of the messages in blackout.

0:01:27.208,0:01:29.583
I'm going to scroll down to

0:01:29.583,0:01:32.458
the fader commands and we'll start by

0:01:32.458,0:01:34.458
controlling the global fader level of

0:01:34.458,0:01:36.083
fader one. So this is

0:01:36.083,0:01:37.875
the message that I'll need to put in

0:01:37.875,0:01:40.333
touch OSC and I can see here in the

0:01:40.333,0:01:41.541
arguments it's going to be

0:01:41.541,0:01:44.791
an integer from 0 to 255. So let's see

0:01:44.791,0:01:46.208
what all of that means. I'm

0:01:46.208,0:01:47.958
going to open touch OSC on my

0:01:47.958,0:01:49.750
phone and then I'm going to press and

0:01:49.750,0:01:51.333
hold in the middle and add

0:01:51.333,0:01:56.833
a fader. I'll make it a bit

0:01:56.833,0:01:59.083
bigger here by just dragging it around.

0:01:59.583,0:02:01.166
With my fader selected I'll

0:02:01.166,0:02:03.333
hit this bar graph icon and

0:02:03.333,0:02:05.125
make sure that in the documentary here my

0:02:05.125,0:02:06.166
fader is still selected

0:02:06.166,0:02:08.541
and I'll scroll down to where

0:02:08.541,0:02:10.916
I can see the messages. For now I'll

0:02:10.916,0:02:12.208
delete the MIDI message out

0:02:12.208,0:02:14.500
by clicking the X and then I'll

0:02:14.541,0:02:17.583
tap on OSC. Now in this section where it

0:02:17.583,0:02:18.833
says address this is

0:02:18.833,0:02:20.333
where I'm going to put the OSC

0:02:20.375,0:02:23.333
path from the blackout documents. I'm

0:02:23.333,0:02:24.208
going to start by pressing

0:02:24.208,0:02:25.666
holding name here and deleting

0:02:25.666,0:02:27.583
it by clicking OK then I'm going to touch

0:02:27.583,0:02:29.708
the slash. In the slash

0:02:29.708,0:02:31.375
I'll write exactly what was

0:02:31.416,0:02:34.333
in the blackout page. So I'll do slash

0:02:34.333,0:02:40.875
BLK slash fader slash global

0:02:40.875,0:02:45.916
slash now here's where I put

0:02:45.916,0:02:49.583
the number I'll do fader one slash level

0:02:49.583,0:02:54.500
and then I'll click enter. Then in

0:02:54.500,0:02:55.750
arguments you'll see

0:02:55.791,0:02:57.958
here it says float I'm going to change

0:02:57.958,0:02:59.166
the conversion to

0:02:59.166,0:03:01.625
integer and I'll send it from 0

0:03:01.625,0:03:04.041
to 255 because again that's what the

0:03:04.041,0:03:07.083
documentation tells us to do. After

0:03:07.083,0:03:08.500
hitting enter I'm going to

0:03:08.500,0:03:12.166
come up to link and go into OSC. Now I

0:03:12.166,0:03:13.000
already have some things

0:03:13.000,0:03:14.625
configured but I'm going to double

0:03:14.666,0:03:16.958
check that it's exactly what blackout's

0:03:16.958,0:03:20.041
expecting. In the host I'm going to put

0:03:20.041,0:03:21.333
the IP address of my

0:03:21.375,0:03:24.333
iPad. Once again looking at the blackout

0:03:24.333,0:03:25.791
page I can see my IP

0:03:25.791,0:03:30.708
address 192.168.0.2 and then this

0:03:30.708,0:03:32.833
part's a bit of a brain teaser so up at

0:03:32.833,0:03:34.291
the top here where it says

0:03:34.291,0:03:36.375
blackout receive address and

0:03:36.375,0:03:40.333
port we see that the port is 9003 so

0:03:40.333,0:03:41.625
that's what I want my send

0:03:41.625,0:03:43.875
port to be in touch OSC and I'll

0:03:43.916,0:03:48.125
make sure that's 9003. Then down in

0:03:48.125,0:03:50.166
blackout this is where it's

0:03:50.166,0:03:52.666
going to be sending any fader

0:03:52.666,0:03:55.458
feedback to my touch OSC device so I'm

0:03:55.458,0:03:56.500
going to change this to the

0:03:56.500,0:03:58.500
IP address of my phone which

0:03:58.500,0:04:04.416
was 192.168.0.19 and then I'll want the

0:04:04.416,0:04:06.291
port to match touch OSC's

0:04:06.291,0:04:09.875
receive port at 9006 so we'll

0:04:09.916,0:04:12.291
make sure that's configured in both and

0:04:12.291,0:04:15.166
then I'll click done. Now

0:04:15.166,0:04:16.875
back in touch OSC I'll hit these

0:04:16.875,0:04:20.208
bar graphs I'll close out of link status

0:04:20.208,0:04:22.125
in blackout and now I'll

0:04:22.125,0:04:23.583
hit this play button. As

0:04:23.583,0:04:26.000
I move the fader on my phone you can see

0:04:26.000,0:04:30.083
it moves in blackout and if

0:04:30.083,0:04:31.375
I move the fader in blackout

0:04:31.375,0:04:35.041
you can see touch OSC follows. Now let's

0:04:35.041,0:04:38.041
add a button give myself

0:04:38.041,0:04:39.250
some more room on the canvas

0:04:39.416,0:04:42.208
here and I'll press and hold in the

0:04:42.208,0:04:43.958
middle of the canvas and add a button.

0:04:46.166,0:04:49.041
This is going to be the

0:04:49.041,0:04:52.416
same process I'll hit the bar graph I'll

0:04:52.416,0:04:56.000
scroll down delete MIDI and

0:04:56.000,0:04:57.541
come into my button messages

0:04:57.583,0:05:02.208
and come into the OSC messages I'll

0:05:02.208,0:05:04.583
delete name by pressing holding I'll come

0:05:04.583,0:05:06.333
to the slash and now

0:05:06.375,0:05:08.000
I'll navigate back to the OSC

0:05:08.000,0:05:11.166
documentation and let's add one of the

0:05:11.166,0:05:12.958
action buttons so we'll do

0:05:13.000,0:05:22.500
slash BLK slash fader slash global slash

0:05:22.500,0:05:31.083
one slash key underscore one

0:05:31.083,0:05:35.125
and I'll hit enter. I'll hit the

0:05:35.125,0:05:37.333
X to check the arguments and here we can

0:05:37.333,0:05:38.750
see it already matches it's

0:05:38.750,0:05:40.416
expecting a float of 0 or 1.

0:05:40.541,0:05:42.416
I'll hit the bar graphs to get out of

0:05:42.416,0:05:44.333
this menu and then I'll hit

0:05:44.333,0:05:46.875
play again. I'll navigate back

0:05:46.875,0:05:48.291
to blackout and since we're already

0:05:48.291,0:05:50.791
linked up I can see as I hit

0:05:50.791,0:05:52.583
the button the toggle works

0:05:52.583,0:05:56.000
and as I move the fader the fader works.

0:05:56.666,0:05:57.708
So that was a super brief

0:05:57.708,0:05:59.458
overview of how to set up OSC

0:05:59.500,0:06:01.583
using touch OSC but the process is the

0:06:01.583,0:06:03.083
exact same for any OSC

0:06:03.083,0:06:05.083
device. You match IP addresses and

0:06:05.333,0:06:06.875
ports and you give it the arguments

0:06:06.875,0:06:09.125
blackout is expecting. Take a look at the

0:06:09.125,0:06:10.208
full OSC documentation

0:06:10.500,0:06:12.958
on our website you can map OSC to any

0:06:12.958,0:06:15.500
control and blackout it's awesome you're

0:06:15.500,0:06:16.375
gonna love it let me

0:06:16.375,0:06:17.625
know in the comments what you want to see

0:06:17.625,0:06:18.875
more of and I'll see you next time.

Did you know there are two ways to

0:00:01.666,0:00:03.416
midi-learn your faders in blackout? So

0:00:03.416,0:00:04.708
let's learn about it.

0:00:04.958,0:00:06.458
So on my fader page, if I go to link

0:00:06.458,0:00:09.291
status, connect to device and midi-learn,

0:00:09.916,0:00:12.000
I can begin to learn my faders. This

0:00:12.000,0:00:14.625
globe icon up at the top, this is our

0:00:14.625,0:00:15.541
magic button. This is

0:00:15.541,0:00:18.166
our global versus local mode. If I tap an

0:00:18.166,0:00:19.958
unassigned fader and then all I have to

0:00:19.958,0:00:21.125
do is move the fader

0:00:21.125,0:00:22.875
I want to assign it to and it learns just

0:00:22.875,0:00:24.000
like that. You'll see at

0:00:24.000,0:00:25.000
the top it's telling me that

0:00:25.041,0:00:27.250
it's a global fader. So if I leave

0:00:27.250,0:00:29.958
midi-learn now and switch to page two, I

0:00:29.958,0:00:31.083
still have control. And

0:00:31.083,0:00:32.958
if I switch back to page one, I still

0:00:32.958,0:00:34.500
have control. But now let's see what

0:00:34.500,0:00:35.625
happens when we learn it as

0:00:35.625,0:00:37.458
a local fader. I'll go back into

0:00:37.458,0:00:39.291
midi-learn and now I'll click the globe

0:00:39.291,0:00:40.833
to learn it as a local

0:00:40.833,0:00:43.291
fader. I'll click an empty fader, go

0:00:43.291,0:00:44.333
ahead and learn it. I love

0:00:44.333,0:00:45.583
how easy that is and I'll

0:00:45.583,0:00:47.625
override it. And you can see that it's

0:00:47.625,0:00:49.500
actually learning fader one

0:00:49.500,0:00:51.916
on page one. So now you'll see

0:00:51.958,0:00:53.875
here I still have control of this fader.

0:00:53.875,0:00:54.750
But if I switch to page

0:00:54.750,0:00:56.916
two, I'm not controlling it

0:00:56.916,0:00:59.291
anymore. I'm still controlling the fader

0:00:59.291,0:01:00.541
on page one. So if I bring

0:01:00.541,0:01:01.750
this to full, when I switch

0:01:01.750,0:01:03.500
back to page one, you'll see it's at

0:01:03.500,0:01:05.500
full, bring it down to zero, it's at

0:01:05.500,0:01:07.250
zero, and it's not affecting

0:01:07.250,0:01:09.000
page two. So that's your quick tip of the

0:01:09.000,0:01:10.208
day. This is super useful

0:01:10.208,0:01:11.500
for customizing your setup

0:01:11.500,0:01:12.958
the way that you want, whether you're

0:01:12.958,0:01:14.000
running a time code show

0:01:14.000,0:01:15.500
with midi or you're just setting

0:01:15.541,0:01:17.000
up your fader board. Lots

0:01:17.000,0:01:18.333
of options here in blackout.

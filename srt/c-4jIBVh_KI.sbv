Hey, everyone.
We're back for another Fader video.

0:00:02.166,0:00:04.541
And this one is all about the 
Fader page UI.

0:00:04.541,0:00:07.625
A s I mentioned in the last video,
just like the sequence series,

0:00:07.791,0:00:11.083
these videos come with a Capture
and a Blackout file, so you can download

0:00:11.083,0:00:14.250
those and play around with some lights
without having to set anything up.

0:00:14.375,0:00:17.666
Check out that other video if you haven't
already, and let's get into it.

0:00:17.750,0:00:21.958
Before we dive into this video,
I want to get philosophical for a second,

0:00:21.958,0:00:24.875
because one of the most common 
questions I get asked is

0:00:24.875,0:00:26.375
What do I use a fader for?

0:00:26.416,0:00:28.458
Do I have a fader for all of my fixtures?

0:00:28.458,0:00:31.083
Do I make a fader for every parameter

0:00:31.083,0:00:33.166
possible and control everything that way?

0:00:33.166,0:00:36.375
And something that really helped me
understand this is the use of the word

0:00:36.416,0:00:37.166
handle.

0:00:37.166,0:00:39.875
A lot of programmers
will call faders handles,

0:00:39.875,0:00:42.750
and the idea is when you make a fader,
you're making something

0:00:42.750,0:00:44.541
that you can grab at an instant.

0:00:44.541,0:00:46.916
So if you're just doing
a super simple commercial

0:00:46.916,0:00:49.000
or narrative shoot
and you're just setting levels

0:00:49.000,0:00:52.875
and making them into looks,
you probably don't need any faders.

0:00:52.958,0:00:56.833
But a fader is really useful for something
that you might need at any moment

0:00:56.833,0:00:58.666
to change - like a light on the camera,

0:00:58.666,0:01:00.458
where itâ€™s moving back and forth from talent

0:01:00.458,0:01:02.000
and you want to ride that level regardless

0:01:02.000,0:01:03.750
of what you've recorded into the look.

0:01:03.750,0:01:05.250
You want to override that with a fader.

0:01:05.250,0:01:07.000
That's a great use for a fader.

0:01:07.000,0:01:09.083
So start thinking about faders as handles,

0:01:09.083,0:01:11.958
things that you can grab at any time
because the order might change.

0:01:11.958,0:01:14.500
And we all know in the film industry
that's always happening.

0:01:14.500,0:01:18.791
So I'm always putting hazers on a fader
because I'm hazing at random moments

0:01:18.791,0:01:20.666
and I don't want to record that
into my looks.

0:01:20.666,0:01:22.291
I'm putting effects on faders.

0:01:22.291,0:01:24.166
I'm putting my battery units on faders

0:01:24.166,0:01:27.958
so I can change all of that at a moment's
notice, regardless of what I recorded.

0:01:28.041,0:01:29.625
We'll talk about this
more in future videos.

0:01:29.625,0:01:32.125
I just wanted to say that
since it comes up so often.

0:00:00.125,0:00:01.583
Let's talk about faders.

0:00:02.208,0:00:02.875
Actually, I need to

0:00:02.875,0:00:04.125
talk a lot about faders

0:00:04.250,0:00:05.000
because there's so

0:00:05.000,0:00:05.958
much you can do with them

0:00:05.958,0:00:07.125
and I've received a ton

0:00:07.125,0:00:08.000
of questions about them.

0:00:08.291,0:00:10.208
So I'm splitting this up into a series

0:00:10.208,0:00:12.041
with more videos coming very soon.

0:00:12.041,0:00:13.250
For this series, just like

0:00:13.250,0:00:14.958
I did in my sequence videos,

0:00:14.958,0:00:16.666
I've made a capture presentation file

0:00:16.666,0:00:17.625
as well as a blackout

0:00:17.625,0:00:19.166
file that you can download

0:00:19.333,0:00:21.208
on your computer, either Mac or PC.

0:00:21.583,0:00:22.750
You don't need to download capture.

0:00:23.000,0:00:24.166
You can just download the file

0:00:24.166,0:00:26.000
and use it right away with your iPad.

0:00:26.000,0:00:27.666
As long as your iPad and the computer

0:00:27.791,0:00:29.500
running the capture presentation file

0:00:29.625,0:00:30.875
are on the same network.

0:00:31.125,0:00:32.500
We're gonna start off super simple,

0:00:32.500,0:00:33.583
just talking about all

0:00:33.583,0:00:34.958
the button options you have

0:00:35.208,0:00:35.916
for your faders.

0:00:36.333,0:00:37.458
Let's get into it.

0:00:37.875,0:00:39.416
Okay, here we are in the file.

0:00:39.416,0:00:41.583
You can see I already have a fader

0:00:42.000,0:00:43.000
for my main sequence

0:00:43.000,0:00:44.041
with some looks made.

0:00:44.041,0:00:45.458
We're gonna make two looks real quick.

0:00:45.875,0:00:46.500
I'm gonna come to my

0:00:46.500,0:00:48.000
groups, grab my bulbs,

0:00:48.500,0:00:50.333
set them to full and I'll

0:00:50.333,0:00:51.333
come to fixture controls

0:00:51.583,0:00:52.791
and make them really blue

0:00:52.791,0:00:55.000
and I will record a new look.

0:00:55.500,0:00:58.083
So I'll change this to sequence two now

0:00:58.791,0:00:59.916
and I'll call this

0:00:59.916,0:01:02.125
flash and that looks good.

0:01:02.125,0:01:03.625
And I'll select manual values only.

0:01:03.625,0:01:04.791
So I only save the manual

0:01:04.791,0:01:06.000
values in this new sequence

0:01:06.541,0:01:07.125
and I'll save.

0:01:07.458,0:01:09.375
I can see my values turn yellow,

0:01:09.583,0:01:11.250
which means they're controlled by a fader

0:01:11.250,0:01:12.500
that I don't have selected.

0:01:13.208,0:01:15.000
So I'll come up here to my main sequence

0:01:15.000,0:01:16.250
and switch over to the

0:01:16.250,0:01:17.875
flash sequence I just created.

0:01:18.916,0:01:20.625
Now I'm just going to

0:01:20.625,0:01:22.625
change these to be warmer.

0:01:23.208,0:01:24.208
So we have a warm flash

0:01:24.208,0:01:25.375
and I'll record again.

0:01:25.708,0:01:26.916
I'll do manual values only

0:01:27.500,0:01:30.416
and I'll call this look warm flash.

0:01:30.875,0:01:31.375
Okay, great.

0:01:31.833,0:01:32.625
And we'll save that.

0:01:33.500,0:01:35.291
So now if I go to my fader page,

0:01:35.291,0:01:36.375
I can see I have a

0:01:36.375,0:01:38.125
second sequence fader created.

0:01:38.375,0:01:40.125
At the bottom, I can see the buttons

0:01:40.125,0:01:41.541
that blackout already assigns

0:01:41.708,0:01:42.583
because blackout knows

0:01:42.583,0:01:43.750
this is a sequence fader.

0:01:43.750,0:01:45.458
It gives me a play and a back button.

0:01:45.833,0:01:47.625
You can see if I hit play here,

0:01:47.958,0:01:49.416
it'll cycle me through the two looks.

0:01:50.000,0:01:51.416
If I hit back, it'll

0:01:51.416,0:01:52.750
reverse me through the two looks.

0:01:53.500,0:01:54.375
You can see this is the

0:01:54.375,0:01:55.541
same for this other sequence.

0:01:55.833,0:01:57.833
So I go through chronologically

0:01:58.250,0:01:59.125
and I can go back

0:01:59.125,0:02:00.833
chronologically as well.

0:02:01.208,0:02:02.750
Okay, so let's take a look

0:02:02.750,0:02:03.708
at some of the other

0:02:03.708,0:02:04.916
buttons we can assign.

0:02:05.916,0:02:07.916
To assign a button to an empty space,

0:02:08.083,0:02:10.250
you can press and hold up top here

0:02:10.750,0:02:12.208
and you'll get the button type pop up.

0:02:12.833,0:02:13.791
You can also press and

0:02:13.791,0:02:14.958
hold on the fader itself

0:02:15.583,0:02:16.916
and assign the buttons in

0:02:16.916,0:02:17.875
the position you'd like.

0:02:18.166,0:02:19.458
For example, if we wanted

0:02:19.458,0:02:21.000
to get rid of the play button

0:02:21.250,0:02:22.583
and just switch it to none,

0:02:22.833,0:02:24.666
we could do that and then save.

0:02:25.291,0:02:25.958
And you can see this

0:02:25.958,0:02:27.208
is a now empty button.

0:02:27.750,0:02:29.250
I can come here and press and hold

0:02:29.875,0:02:31.916
and reassign it to play and save.

0:02:32.291,0:02:33.500
Okay, so what are the button types?

0:02:33.875,0:02:34.708
The first button type

0:02:34.708,0:02:36.541
is none, which is empty.

0:02:36.791,0:02:37.541
It doesn't do anything.

0:02:38.416,0:02:40.125
The next button type is flash.

0:02:40.500,0:02:41.291
And for flash, we get

0:02:41.291,0:02:42.875
three options, flash return,

0:02:43.333,0:02:44.708
flash on and flash off.

0:02:45.083,0:02:46.000
A flash button means

0:02:46.000,0:02:47.000
when you're holding it,

0:02:47.166,0:02:48.333
the fader goes to 100.

0:02:48.625,0:02:49.708
And when you let go,

0:02:50.000,0:02:51.125
the fader will return

0:02:51.125,0:02:52.750
to one of the states you've specified.

0:02:53.541,0:02:54.750
So if we do flash

0:02:54.750,0:02:56.875
return, the fader will return

0:02:56.875,0:02:58.500
to whatever state it was last in.

0:02:58.791,0:02:59.500
Let's test that out.

0:02:59.875,0:03:00.666
So here I can see the

0:03:00.666,0:03:02.000
fader is at 100 and off.

0:03:02.375,0:03:03.500
If I flash and let go,

0:03:03.500,0:03:04.625
it returns to that state.

0:03:05.166,0:03:07.041
If I double tap to toggle it

0:03:07.041,0:03:08.916
on and move it to the middle,

0:03:09.500,0:03:11.875
if I flash, it'll go to 100 and I let go,

0:03:12.166,0:03:13.666
it returns on and to the middle.

0:03:14.500,0:03:16.125
If I double tap to turn it off

0:03:16.833,0:03:18.000
and I flash and I let

0:03:18.000,0:03:18.958
go, you'll see it returns

0:03:18.958,0:03:20.083
to that state as well.

0:03:20.458,0:03:21.416
If I press and hold here

0:03:21.416,0:03:23.166
and go into my flash settings

0:03:23.166,0:03:24.708
by clicking on it and

0:03:24.708,0:03:25.750
change it to flash on,

0:03:26.000,0:03:26.875
as you can see, the

0:03:26.875,0:03:28.000
fader is off right now.

0:03:28.291,0:03:29.750
But if I flash it and

0:03:29.750,0:03:31.125
let go, it stays on.

0:03:31.583,0:03:32.625
Flash stays on.

0:03:32.875,0:03:35.666
If I press and hold and click my flash

0:03:36.166,0:03:38.708
and change it to flash off and save,

0:03:39.041,0:03:39.916
if I turn it on and

0:03:39.916,0:03:41.166
flash it, it will turn off.

0:03:42.375,0:03:43.083
Let's look at temp.

0:03:43.583,0:03:45.333
Temp stands for temporary and allows you

0:03:45.416,0:03:47.291
to set specific timings for your fader.

0:03:47.958,0:03:50.625
I'll keep it on auto for now and save.

0:03:51.083,0:03:52.250
And you can see, if I

0:03:52.250,0:03:53.250
start the fader at zero

0:03:53.500,0:03:54.791
and hold temp, it will

0:03:54.791,0:03:55.708
come up for one second.

0:03:56.000,0:03:57.458
And when I let go, it'll

0:03:57.458,0:03:58.500
go down for one second.

0:03:59.375,0:04:00.250
You can adjust these

0:04:00.250,0:04:01.958
settings in the temp settings.

0:04:01.958,0:04:02.833
If I click here, you can

0:04:02.833,0:04:04.166
see my uptime is one second,

0:04:04.541,0:04:05.916
my downtime is one second,

0:04:06.125,0:04:07.291
and it has no wait time

0:04:07.291,0:04:08.583
before transitioning down.

0:04:08.875,0:04:10.000
If you switched this to

0:04:10.000,0:04:11.708
manual, you'll have to tap again

0:04:11.708,0:04:13.000
to send the fader back down.

0:04:13.750,0:04:15.541
So if I save that now and

0:04:15.541,0:04:17.000
I temp it up, it goes up.

0:04:18.083,0:04:19.791
If I tap it again, it'll go down.

0:04:20.750,0:04:22.916
Tap up, tap again, it goes down.

0:04:24.125,0:04:24.625
That's temp.

0:04:25.625,0:04:26.833
Of course, you can assign

0:04:26.833,0:04:28.083
these to any times you'd like.

0:04:28.625,0:04:29.666
Toggle does the same thing

0:04:29.666,0:04:30.875
as double tapping the fader.

0:04:31.125,0:04:32.500
It either turns it on or

0:04:32.500,0:04:33.791
off depending on what state

0:04:33.791,0:04:34.541
it was last in.

0:04:35.000,0:04:36.083
If I save that, you can

0:04:36.083,0:04:37.291
see it's off right now

0:04:37.291,0:04:38.250
because it's grayed out.

0:04:38.833,0:04:40.250
If I hit toggle, it turns on.

0:04:40.708,0:04:42.291
If I hit toggle again, it turns off.

0:04:43.083,0:04:44.500
Toggle on, toggle off.

0:04:44.500,0:04:45.416
I'll skip black for now

0:04:45.416,0:04:46.708
to say that on and off

0:04:46.708,0:04:47.958
do exactly what you expect.

0:04:48.791,0:04:50.583
I'll set one button on and

0:04:50.583,0:04:52.000
I'll set this top button to off.

0:04:52.416,0:04:53.375
And now if I save this

0:04:53.375,0:04:55.291
and turn the fader on,

0:04:55.291,0:04:56.791
it'll turn on and I can

0:04:56.791,0:04:57.958
use off to turn it off.

0:04:59.458,0:05:00.750
Okay, let's look at black now.

0:05:01.000,0:05:02.583
I'll change this off to a black.

0:05:03.583,0:05:05.000
Black is the reverse of flash.

0:05:05.416,0:05:06.541
So while you're holding it,

0:05:06.541,0:05:07.541
the fader will go to zero.

0:05:07.833,0:05:09.375
And when you let go, it will release.

0:05:10.416,0:05:12.000
So here I'll send the fader to 100

0:05:12.458,0:05:13.625
and then hold the black button.

0:05:14.083,0:05:14.708
It goes down.

0:05:14.708,0:05:16.375
When I let go, it releases back.

0:05:19.125,0:05:20.250
Next is selfix.

0:05:20.791,0:05:22.250
selfix stands for select fixtures

0:05:22.583,0:05:24.291
and it will just select via command line

0:05:24.291,0:05:25.250
all the fixtures that

0:05:25.250,0:05:26.666
have data within that fader.

0:05:26.666,0:05:28.291
And this works for all types of faders.

0:05:28.583,0:05:29.500
Let's try it out.

0:05:29.500,0:05:30.458
I'll save this as selfix.

0:05:30.666,0:05:31.750
I'll clear my command line.

0:05:32.333,0:05:33.541
And then if I click this button,

0:05:34.000,0:05:35.500
you can see in the bottom,

0:05:35.500,0:05:37.000
it will select all my bulbs.

0:05:37.500,0:05:38.958
If I press and hold on this sequence

0:05:39.250,0:05:40.500
and add a selfix button,

0:05:40.500,0:05:41.916
you can see if I click selfix,

0:05:42.375,0:05:43.500
it will also add all the

0:05:43.500,0:05:44.833
fixtures in that sequence.

0:05:45.208,0:05:46.125
This is a super helpful

0:05:46.125,0:05:47.375
button to have on your hardware,

0:05:47.375,0:05:48.750
like a stream deck or keyboard,

0:05:49.166,0:05:49.916
because in your main

0:05:49.916,0:05:51.416
sequence, I can just hit selfix

0:05:51.750,0:05:53.083
and then use the master scroll wheel

0:05:53.083,0:05:54.541
to dim everything up or down.

0:05:54.541,0:05:55.541
I'll hit selfix here.

0:05:55.833,0:05:58.041
And then I can be in my fixture page

0:05:58.541,0:05:59.583
and use the master scroll

0:05:59.583,0:06:01.000
wheel to dim everything down

0:06:01.500,0:06:02.458
or dim everything up.

0:06:03.500,0:06:04.041
Super awesome.

0:06:04.375,0:06:05.333
Let's pick a new button.

0:06:05.708,0:06:06.875
Next we have macro,

0:06:06.875,0:06:08.208
which is not yet implemented,

0:06:08.208,0:06:10.125
but that will allow you to set a macro

0:06:10.125,0:06:11.666
to trigger from this button.

0:06:11.708,0:06:13.166
Next we have play and back.

0:06:13.500,0:06:15.250
As we saw before, these are auto assigned

0:06:15.250,0:06:16.458
on every sequence fader.

0:06:16.666,0:06:17.708
Of course you can change them,

0:06:17.916,0:06:18.875
but they play through

0:06:18.875,0:06:20.416
looks with respect to timing.

0:06:20.666,0:06:21.875
I'll double tap looks to

0:06:21.875,0:06:23.041
give my sequence some timing.

0:06:23.333,0:06:25.041
And then coming back to my fader page,

0:06:25.041,0:06:25.833
I can see the timing

0:06:25.833,0:06:27.125
activates when I hit play.

0:06:27.500,0:06:28.750
If you want your sequence to

0:06:28.750,0:06:30.041
use timing when you go back,

0:06:30.250,0:06:32.250
you can change this in blackout settings

0:06:32.875,0:06:33.958
by toggling default back

0:06:33.958,0:06:35.541
button behavior to look timing.

0:06:36.000,0:06:37.125
Next, we have the fast

0:06:37.125,0:06:38.875
back and fast forward buttons.

0:06:39.666,0:06:41.000
These are just like playing back,

0:06:41.291,0:06:42.625
except they ignore look timing.

0:06:42.875,0:06:43.791
These will allow you to

0:06:43.791,0:06:44.916
quickly go through your looks

0:06:45.083,0:06:46.791
while ignoring any timing you've set.

0:06:47.166,0:06:48.333
Top will take you to your

0:06:48.333,0:06:49.500
first look in the sequence.

0:06:49.875,0:06:50.750
Let's take a look at that.

0:06:51.041,0:06:52.375
Here I'm on my last look.

0:06:52.666,0:06:53.875
If I select top, I'll

0:06:53.875,0:06:55.000
go back to my first look

0:06:55.250,0:06:56.333
with respect to timing.

0:06:56.666,0:06:58.166
I'll change top to go to,

0:06:58.458,0:06:59.833
and go to allows you to

0:06:59.833,0:07:00.791
pick which look you're in

0:07:00.791,0:07:01.500
from a list.

0:07:01.750,0:07:03.375
I'll tap go to, and now I

0:07:03.375,0:07:04.666
can pick between any look

0:07:04.666,0:07:05.833
and go to them with

0:07:05.833,0:07:06.916
respect to look timing.

0:07:07.250,0:07:08.166
Last is select.

0:07:08.375,0:07:10.083
I'll put select on both sequences

0:07:10.541,0:07:11.833
and select just allows me

0:07:11.833,0:07:13.333
to switch between sequences.

0:07:14.833,0:07:16.541
Right now, if I go to my fixture page,

0:07:16.541,0:07:18.125
I can see I'm in my main sequence.

0:07:19.166,0:07:20.458
If I go to my fader page and

0:07:20.458,0:07:22.416
now select this bar up here

0:07:22.500,0:07:24.416
indicates which sequence is selected.

0:07:25.291,0:07:26.666
If I select sequence two

0:07:26.666,0:07:28.250
here, this bar changes.

0:07:28.916,0:07:30.125
And if I come out here, I can

0:07:30.125,0:07:31.250
see I'm now in that sequence.

0:07:31.666,0:07:32.125
Again, this is

0:07:32.125,0:07:33.458
another really useful button

0:07:33.458,0:07:34.583
to have mapped to hardware.

0:07:34.875,0:07:35.500
So if you have a bunch

0:07:35.500,0:07:36.416
of different sequences

0:07:36.625,0:07:37.750
and you need to update one,

0:07:38.000,0:07:38.791
you can select that

0:07:38.791,0:07:39.875
sequence and then update.

0:07:40.250,0:07:41.208
If I come to this fader

0:07:41.208,0:07:42.416
three and load a fixture

0:07:43.416,0:07:44.583
and select an empty button,

0:07:44.958,0:07:46.541
you'll see you're given just the options

0:07:46.541,0:07:48.208
that apply to a fixture fader.

0:07:49.458,0:07:50.500
So that's a bit of a speed

0:07:50.500,0:07:51.708
run of all the fader buttons.

0:07:51.916,0:07:53.000
Hope that was helpful.

0:07:53.000,0:07:54.500
In upcoming videos, we'll look at the

0:07:54.500,0:07:55.875
entire fader page UI,

0:07:56.125,0:07:57.875
the settings in the fader configuration,

0:07:58.250,0:07:59.958
and of course the fader priorities.

0:08:00.333,0:08:01.291
Let me know in the comments

0:08:01.291,0:08:02.416
what you wanna see more of,

0:08:02.416,0:08:03.333
and I'll see you next time.
